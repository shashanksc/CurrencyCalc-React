The React Currency Converter is a web application that enables users to perform currency conversions using the [API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/). With a simple and user-friendly interface, this app allows users to select the currencies they want to convert from and to, specify the amount, and instantly get the converted result. This app provides real-time exchange rate data for over 150+ currencies. It is built using React, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Axios, and Moment libraries.

## Features

- Choose the currency to convert from a drop-down list.
- Select the currency to convert to from another drop-down list.
- Input the amount to be converted.
- Fetch the current exchange rate and get the converted amount.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript, adding type checking to your code.
- Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive and visually appealing designs.
